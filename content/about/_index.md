:wave: I'm Andrew, thanks for dropping by!

I started this site as a creative outlet to help structure many of my unstructured musings ([-- origin](/writings/hello-world/)). It's a guilt-free playground for me to have things "publicized" for potential sharing, but it's also a not too public home for some of the writings that leave me feeling butt-naked and massively ~cringed~ afterwards. 

I've always been the guy prone to the type of "Im14andthisisdeep" trains of thoughts (which I probably took a little bit too seriously before). But I figure I would rather pen them down somewhere than to let it fade into oblivion as I slowly adultify, so yea :).

I haven't fully figure out where everything will be and where my future writing ambition might take me; some will be on [medium](https://medium.com/@mugseller22) or [goodread](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/151993489-andrew-chen). In the off chance you find my ramblings interesting :), you can subscribe on [RSS](/rss.xml) or reach me by [email](mailto:mugseller22@gmail.com).

The site name, 心宇, is part of my chinese name, which means the heart & the cosmos. It is one which I hope to live up to.
