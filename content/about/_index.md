:wave: I'm Andrew, thanks for dropping by!

This site is both a creative outlet for my writings and note/reflections for any new things I learn. Currently I'm interested in learning about the world religions. You can read more about why I started this blog [here](/writings/hello-world/). You can also find me on [medium](https://medium.com/@mugseller22) for some of the stuff I write here. In the off chance you find my ramblings interesting :), you can subscribe via [RSS](/rss.xml) and reach me by [email](mailto:mugseller22@gmail.com).

Few things about me, I'm a coder by trade, currently working at a big tech in the daylight. I'm somewhat a massive weeb and interested in any good Japanese literature, anime, JRPGs, etc. I don't watch as many American shows, but I really enjoy the ones I have (huge fanboy of Mike Schur and [The Good Place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good_Place)). I grew up in Shanghai and North Carolina. The site's name is part of my Chinese name: 心宇, which means the heart & the cosmos. It is one which I hope to live up to.
