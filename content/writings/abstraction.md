2 months back I started volunteering at a local high school as a classroom assistant for AP Computer Science; it's something I've signed up to both test the water of teaching and have as a quiet escapism from my day job. Going back to high school, as cliche as this sounds, feels like I've never left: there's this weird mix of vitality and confinment that's only unique to highschool whenever I walked amongst the kids getting to class (oh and the hallway has a familiar layout and the same disinfective spray smell of my high school).

The class, it feels stupidly easy; It brought back many memories as it's origin of a concept that perplexed me when I was in highschool, grappling with idea of abstraction. Maybe I'm biased, but a clear definition abstraction is thrown
- lingo

It did put me back to origin of my way to view the world as an engineer. 

OOP. For non-tech background. Telling computer to do things, you need to design the language in some way (with grammar, with basic words), OOP is just a way to structure program. The basic words in this language is object.

Object, People

Square
- diameter
- circumference

Side note: OOP apparently suffer from a lot of problem as code base grows

---

Moving from OOP, another word I pick up is "level", level of abstractions

Hardware to software

Internet is a layer of stacks

---

Lastly, is philosophy
Abstract, what is abstract. What is? Philosophize
- Most generic

Take a definition
- Representing a part as the whole (TODO: find where this comes from, I think from infinite game book) 

Word game I played with myself before, I flat out every term

a -> b -> c -> d

Analytical philosophers tend to do this stuff, and I just so happened to think in those way (and English is my second language you have to learn by translation), that is to say my mind automatically zooms into that makes me both easily focus on things and nothing in particular. Think in frames (framing effect), my mind has the propensity to break things down.

Only particular aspect of the abstraction is the handle to next thought

- Side note here: I thought before that your ability to know things (understand down to the metal) is sign of smartness (reducing abstraction); some self complacency but is far from truth; The reality is the ability to weave in between abstractions; less is more. Engineers are not the same breed as Business. 
- Especially an important skill for software engineers as I see (high level), that probably warrants another post.

Common theme of abstraction, is that it's fundamentally hiding information

Abstraction is an element of judgement (you judge things to do action, and to take action you don't be a scientist, you take the limited information to make a decision to act, representing the parts you see as the whole for decision guiding) 

People hate judgement because they don't represent us

Our ability to abstract Capacity for evil. Innate in everyone

Evil
- If animals were to know, I'm absolutely evil to the animals eating them
