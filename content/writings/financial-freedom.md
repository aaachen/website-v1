summary: money from the grounds of freedom
---

One day when I was going through my credit card history with all the bills and records of recent spending spree, two random thoughts sorta popped in my head

1. Money is the greatest limiter there is to the freedom of societal members
1. Poor men are thus the least free, and rich men the most free

The saying that "money buys you freedom" was always something I've heard many times before but not truly understood until now. As a kid, I remember never having an intense desire to *want* to have money; if anything, I would feel somewhat ashamed that I did. This probably came from both a developing awareness that I was more well off comparing to my peers in Elementary school as well as a sense of protected naivety rooted in my Christian upbringing; money is the corrupter of hearts, and afterall, it's the poor and the meek who would inherit the kingdom of heaven. Ironically though, never has there been a time of me *wanting* to have more money than I have now. With my general tendency to formalize things beyond necessity for my own satisfaction, here's some of the unravelling:

Freedom is a pretty vague word that means different things to a lot of different people, but conventionally speaking, there are two general components to it:
1. The amount of options made available to the agent (a.k.a choices)
1. The ability for the agent to *choose* one of those options undeterred (a.k.a. the notorious free will)

The degree of freedom one has usually correlates to the scale to those two things: You are not free either because only a few options are made accessible to you (i.e. opportunities), or because you lack the ability and *power* to choose amongst them (i.e. addictions, genetics). And despite the somewhat distinct categories drawn here, the line is often blurrier in reality with the two constantly feeding upon and limiting each other. It's like how in a story-telling RPG, the choices you make in a scenario opens up a range of dialogue options you have; the limited options then shape the pattern and habit of the person further making those choices.

What I had in mind though about freedom was more so centered around the options part, which I see as the principal limiter of the two. To have freedom with *only* the latter (free will) is akin to the freedom an astronaut has floating in a sea of vacuum: he can sway his arms and kick his limbs however he wants, but he has nowhere to go and nothing else to do besides; there is always a limiting context where freedom is excercised within.

And so, for people living inside the confines of society (that is basically everyone), money is *the* quantified measure of options an individual may have. Every service, every goods, every physical resource of value is gated behind a pay wall with a price tag. Money is the key to getting past this toll; it is the context and extent to which we can excercise our freedom.

Because poor people are those who do not have money, they are, by definition, the least free.

Money didn't really feel like a *real* thing to me before when I was a kid; there was always this odd disconnection in my mind between the abstract idea of *value* and the concrete dollar bills representing it, and value was always the more apparent thing of the two. For the middle school Andrew, it was possessing the ultimate-rare black eyed rose dragon in my Yu-gi-oh collection; for the high school Andrew, it was getting good grades and GPAs; for the college Andrew, it was about landing a reputable job.

After the time pop died in my last semester of college, I started to reflect a lot about what value really means to me. At the time, to validate/justify some of my own deviant idealism, I tried to [change my perception of values](/writings/what-i-learned-about-value-from-losing-my-dad/) from a hierarchy one into a graph, with different needs seen equally and connected with freer flowing orders varied by circumstances and the individuals reacting to them [^1].

<img alt="value order 2" src="/images/value-order-2.jpeg" title="value order of devout Christian monk living in poverty, love of God may still triumph all things else" />

Value, with all its nebulosity, remained in the forefront then as a theoretical idea spinning inside my head. But after few years of working and becoming more as an integrated part of society, money very quickly surfaced its way up into my broader consciousness. It's an inescapble truth that comes from managing the credit card bills and the intricate tax forms, to ordering from the restaurant menus and feeling the active effects of price inflation day after day, to rushing our cat into the ER in 2am and staring at the string of digits on the white screen after the treatment briefing.

*Life is not exactly easy*. And I realize just how much of a late bloom baby I am in those times. For all I was provided, I took them largely for granted.. It's also those times that made me realize that my needs are not just individual needs occuring inside my own world, but needs connected to every one else's needs in a broader context. The prices gating the needs is situated in a crazy complex world of capital and supply chain that ultimately elevate to competitions happening at a national level, where countries are constantly beefing with each other through physical and economic means.

Despite growing to become more practical in my concerns (in which my young self often protested silently), there was something about money I couldn't fully see before as a kid in my idealist outlooks. Above everything that money brings, be it prestige or power, it is linked to our basic concern of freedom as human beings living inside a highly systematized world. And in many regards, this world as imagined by humans also reflect the need for freedom of individual humans. 

Companies, like humans, operate in degrees of freedom corresponding to the money it has. The more money it has, the bigger and more powerful they grow, and the more freedom it has in its various business reaches (though coming at a sacrifice of individual freedom in the company). Its freedom permits room for risk taking and toleration risk setbacks. Inflation is when everyone collectively loses freedom, as the purchasing power of their money in the pocket drops. The death of companies and countries, like humans, is the ultimate depletion of freedom, where no more options are left.

[^1]: In large part, this revolution was a product of an environment where the effort to satisfy existential needs are reduced down to triviality, allowing them to be seen equal in the first place. For most of us (who are not the idealist artists with complete dedication to their immortal crafts, or monks practicing asceticism), the order of existence begins at the physical.
