**TLDR:**
1. space to organize and cleanup my thoughts (currently with religion)
2. ~~live notebook of books (+ movies + animes + blogs)~~
3. playground for creative writing

I wanted to setup this blog for the longest time ever since college. It was a pretty turbulent four years for me with a bunch of first times: first time when life becomes less of a linear path as dictated by a fixed high school routine, first time when career becomes more of a reality instead of a distant figment of adulthood, first time when I started a relationship with little certainty in sight, etc, etc. Looking back now, it wasn't all misery fest as I felt when going through it (I think I just have trouble dealing with changes). But for a large part of these four years, I was preoccupied with a constant anxiety; it was the first time when I seriously came to question just about every aspect of the religion I was raised in, started with the things I was learning in books/courses/videos in academic subjects, which got carried into my interactions and talks with ranges of people, exploring these things myself outside the confines of a familiar church environment dedicated to keep one guided on an expected path. It was a tough thing for me to go through emotionally then, a slow process that broke down the view of my identity and the surrounding world that I knew of into millions of pieces. As a full blown INFP then, I coped with it mostly through talking inside of my own head, with battles of beliefs waged internally and thoughts accumulated into the various notes sitting in my iphone. It is still something that I am slowly working my way through now and is the primary reason I wanted to start this blog, both as a place to put those scattered notes into a more organized format as well as a space of interfaith dialogue for anyone interested. It is so I can better eventually move past them knowing why I believe the things I believe, why I did the things I did, and why I become the person I am.

***2023-01 Update: Largely moving this to [GoodRead](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/151993489-andrew-chen)***

On this related note, I was going back to some of my old books to write about this journey, and I was surprised to find just how much the information there I now have no recollection of learning. Although this is mostly a natural product of time, my not-so-good memory, and me simply not using them, it's probably also a consequence of me receiving information too passively the first time I was learning. So to help with this and also help myself get back into a habit of reading, this site would serve as a live notebook of sort for me to digest and jot down interpretations (in practice of the [feynmann technique](https://fs.blog/feynman-technique/))

Lastly, I wanted to have my own playground to test the water a bit with fiction/creative writing. After falling off a bit from (academic) philosophy, it came as a rather new revelation to me, that story is the most powerful and natural medium to approximate the human experience; in college I was drawn to philosophy initially in pursuit of finding something "foundational" to this, be it language, epistemology, ethics, logic, etc. While the philosophical treatise I was reading do this by abstracting the concrete, phenomenal experiences into atomic truth statements and propositional arrangements, stories are the reverse, in that they place careful thoughts onto the so called "not truth bearing" details relevant to the psyche, which different mediums excel in different ways: the social, historical, and geographical setting, the color and the mood, the personalities and backstories of the characters, their intonation and composure, their actions and motives, etc. In the totality of this, the story teller sets the stage to bring forth previously overlooked details of life or even morally reprehended tabboos/social mores and show their purposes of existence. I personally find stories to have more convincing power than arguments (or at least more effective in doing so), because they show that the dynamic between truths and beliefs are always contextually situated in a myriad of connected circumstances rather than arrived by the pure logical evaluation for the hand selected few propositions. Wondering of how and why compelling stories are compelling is something I enjoy far more than coming up with and analyzing arguments in the vacuum. I think I was always more-or-less drawn to stories of all kinds when I was young. With the unearned ego of a kid, I thought that one day I can create my own that are just as good if not better. This site is for keeping that childhood dream alive
